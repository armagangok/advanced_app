### 3) Advanced Topics & Best Practices

#### Clean Architecture, DDD, SOLID in Flutter
- Prefer domain models with invariants and value objects
- Use application services/use-cases to orchestrate workflows
- Keep UI dumb; map domain ‚Üí presentation models
- Isolate infrastructure (API/DB) behind repositories

#### Advanced State Management (Riverpod)
- When to use Riverpod vs alternatives (Bloc, Provider, ValueNotifier)
- Patterns: state machines, sealed states, union types with freezed
- Side-effects in services/repositories; keep widgets declarative
- Provider families for parameterized state; `ref.listen` for reactions
- Use `AsyncValue` for async UI states; model errors and retries explicitly
- Prefer `select`/scoped providers to minimize rebuilds

#### Performance Profiling & Optimization
- Minimize rebuilds (selective providers, keys, const widgets)
- Precache images, defer heavy work to isolates
- Use Sliver widgets and pagination
- Profile startup and shader compilation; consider SkSL warm-up on Android

#### Testing Strategy
- Test pyramid: many unit, fewer widget, fewer integration
- Golden tests for design regressions
- Contract tests for API models/mappers
- Deterministic fixtures and fakes; hermetic tests in CI
- Override providers in tests via `ProviderScope(overrides: [...])`

#### CI/CD & Automation
- Enforce format/lints, tests, and size/perf budgets on PRs
- Signed builds, automated provisioning, changelog and version bumping
- Staged rollout and release health monitoring

#### Flutter for Web/Desktop
- Layout with constraints, breakpoints, and media queries
- Focus/keyboard systems, tooltips, hover states
- Text rendering nuances and asset pipelines for web

#### Package Development & OSS
- Clear API surface, semver, changelog, migration guides
- Example app and README with usage snippets
- CI with tests and analysis; minimal dependencies

#### Flutter Internals
- Rendering pipeline: widgets ‚Üí elements ‚Üí render objects ‚Üí layers ‚Üí Skia
- Frame lifecycle and scheduling; avoiding layout thrash
- Platform channels, platform views, and threading models

### 4) Career Growth & Soft Skills

#### Code Review Mindset
- Review for correctness, clarity, cohesion, and long-term maintainability
- Prefer questions and suggestions; focus on learning outcomes

#### Mentoring & Communication
- Pair weekly with a junior; set explicit learning goals
- Write concise design docs; communicate trade-offs and risks early

#### System Design for Mobile
- Define boundaries, data ownership, caching strategies, error budgets
- Plan for migrations and backward compatibility

#### Technical Decision-Making
- Use ADRs to capture decisions, context, and alternatives
- Establish architecture principles for the team and stick to them

#### Community & Learning Loop
- Present brown-bags; contribute docs or small OSS fixes
- Curate a personal ‚ÄúFlutter Radar‚Äù of changes each month

üß† Tip: Keep a ‚Äúdecision journal‚Äù for major designs; revisit impact after 1‚Äì3 months.

---

### 5) Capstone Challenges (Proof of Senior Competency)
- Build an offline-first app with conflict resolution and background sync
- Implement a full CI/CD pipeline with automated tests and phased releases
- Publish and maintain a package used by at least one external project
